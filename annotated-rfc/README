These are the HTTP/1.1 RFCs, with each line indented with "# ". Requirements 
or considerations for our implementation can therefore easily be added 
inline and quickly identified if they are prefixed with "# "

Since all RFCs are non-free, they are not stored in the repository but there 
is a script that downloads and patches them, with local modifications. you 
can then edit the result and re-calc the patches. The way this works is:

1. Download the rfcs into .orig an create local versions (-annotated.txt) of 
   them with "./get-and-patch"

2. Edit these annotated files by adding paragraphs indented and marked with 
   "# ". Before checking into the repository, updat the diffs with
    "./update-diffs". Do not check in the annotated files, just the diffs.

3. If you want to remove temporary files, "./clean" does that for you
